Project Name: Optimizing Pomegranate Disease Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models 

Pomegranate is a highly valuable fruit widely cultivated across various countries, yet it faces significant challenges from plant diseases that lead to considerable crop losses and diminished yields. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for enhancing productivity and minimizing economic losses. This study explores the use of image processing and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques for detecting pomegranate diseases. We evaluate the performance of six deep learning models DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, Xception, VGG-19, VGG-16, and InceptionV3 on a dataset of pomegranate images. Xception, in particular, demonstrated exceptional computational efficiency and accuracy, achieving an impressive 97% overall accuracy. 

Data Collection: The training and validation datasets for this study were sourced from Kaggle picture data.The dataset's training folder contains five subfolders with both healthy and diseased pomegranates in .jpg format. Using information from both sources, five groups were created from the dataset, the names of these subfolders are listed in Fig. 1. which consists of 3,568 training photos and 1,531 validation images.. A flowchart in Fig. 2 illustrates the complete workflow of the analysis. To gain a thorough understanding of the process of detecting pomegranate diseases, this research employs TL techniques.
